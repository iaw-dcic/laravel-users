`php artisan make:auth`

`php artisan migrate`

`https://github.com/laravel/socialite`

`composer require laravel/socialite`

To get started with Socialite, use Composer to add the package to your project's dependencies:

    composer require laravel/socialite

### Configuration

After installing the Socialite library, register the Laravel\Socialite\SocialiteServiceProvider in your config/app.php configuration file:

```
'providers' => [
    // Other service providers...

    Laravel\Socialite\SocialiteServiceProvider::class,
],
```

Also, add the `Socialite` facade to the `aliases` array in your `app` configuration file:

```php
'Socialite' => Laravel\Socialite\Facades\Socialite::class,
```

You will also need to add credentials for the OAuth services your application utilizes. These credentials should be placed in your `config/services.php` configuration file, and should use the key `facebook`, `twitter`, `linkedin`, `google`, `github` or `bitbucket`, depending on the providers your application requires. For example:
```php
'github' => [
    'client_id' => 'your-github-app-id',
    'client_secret' => 'your-github-app-secret',
    'redirect' => 'http://your-callback-url',
],
```

### Basic Usage

Next, you are ready to authenticate users! You will need two routes: one for redirecting the user to the OAuth provider, and another for receiving the callback from the provider after authentication. We will access Socialite using the `Socialite` facade:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers\Auth;

use Socialite;

class LoginController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Redirect the user to the GitHub authentication page.
     *
     * @return Response
     */
    public function redirectToProvider()
    {
        return Socialite::driver('github')->redirect();
    }

    /**
     * Obtain the user information from GitHub.
     *
     * @return Response
     */
    public function handleProviderCallback()
    {
		$github = Socialite::driver('github')->user();

        $user = User::whereEmail($github->getEmail())->first();    

        if (!$user) {
            $user = User::create([
                'email' => $github->getEmail(),
                'name' => $github->getName(),
                'password' => bcrypt('password'),
            ]);
        }

        auth()->login($user);

        return redirect()->to('/home');
    }
}
```

Of course, you will need to define routes to your controller methods:

```php
Route::get('login/github', 'Auth\LoginController@redirectToProvider')->name('github');
Route::get('login/github/callback', 'Auth\LoginController@handleProviderCallback');
```

## Official Documentation

In addition to typical, form based authentication, Laravel also provides a simple, convenient way to authenticate with OAuth providers using [Laravel Socialite](https://github.com/laravel/socialite). Socialite currently supports authentication with Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google, GitHub and Bitbucket.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb combination of simplicity, elegance, and innovation give you tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
